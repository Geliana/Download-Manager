The idea for a download manager was born when my internet download manager expired.
i was new to python and wanted a project that could do help me learn while accomplishing a real world
problem at least one that didn't sound too dramatic or wasn't an understatement of my intellectual capabilities.

i begun on 10/18/2021 and since then it has grown into something marvelous. i am just a beginner so the basic rules of
efficient coding are still new to me. I have tried documenting where i could the best i could.
